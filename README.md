# PhotonEngine
Chat application made in C++ with Photon Engine.  

I made this project when I was a student. I did not made an input to insert in custom names and also the special encryption key so this would have to be done through Visual Studio. Also even though it says "vc17", don't be worried it was upgraded to use Visual Studio 2019.
